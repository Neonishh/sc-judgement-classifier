The petitioner did  not\\nfile any objection to the proposed acquisition under a. 8 of\\nthe  Act  (20 of 1957).  In reply to the intimation  by  the\\nGovernment  that the area in question appears to  have  been\\nnotified,  the petitioner asserted that he was not bound  in\\nlaw  by the aforesaid notifications.  According to  him,  he\\nstarted working the colliery immediately after purchasing it\\nin  1956.   This was denied by the respondents and  on  this\\nissue the High Court found against the petitioner.  Under s.\\n4(4)  of  the  Act (20 of 1957)  the  Union  Government  was\\nprohibited  from  acquiring \\\"that portion of land  in  which\\ncoal  mining  operations are actually being  carried  on  in\\nconformity  with the provisions of any enactment,  rule,  or\\norder for the time being in force\\\".  The respondents relying\\non  the provision, however, said further that even if it  be\\nassumed  that the petitioner worked the mines, this was  not\\ndone  in accordance with law.  On this point also  the  High\\nCourt  held  against  the  petitioner.   Against  this   the\\npetitioner argued that r. 39 of the Coal Mines (Conservation\\nand Safety) Rules, 1954, under which the Coal Board  refused\\npermission to open the colliery was ultra vires as the Union\\nGovernment  could not make this rule under s. 17 of the  Act\\n(12  of  1952) and it was this illegal refusal to  open  the\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 2 of 8 \\nmines that resulted in the colliery not being worked at  the\\ntime of the notifications. the petitioner further  contended\\nthat  even  if r. 39 was valid permission was  refused  mala\\nfide,  with the ulterior object of avoiding the  prohibition\\nlaid  down  in  s.  4(4)  of the  Act  (20  of  1957).   The\\nrespondents  objected that the petitioner had  acquired  the\\nlease in contravention of the law and therefore had no right\\nto  allege  that r. 39 of the Coal Mines  (Conservation  and\\nSafety) Rules was violative of Art. 19 of the  Constitution.\\nTo  defeat  this objection the petitioner raised  the  point\\nthat  rr. 37 and 48 of the Mines & Minerals (Regulation  and\\nDevelopment)  Rules  were ultra vires the Mines  &  Minerals\\n(Regulation and Development) Act, 1948.\\nHELD : (i) The notifications were not vitiated on account of\\nany  mala fides.  That there was delay in disposing  of  the\\npetitioner\\u2019s  representations  is  evident  but  delay,   by\\nitself,  is hardly evidence of mala fide, specially  as  the\\nCoal  Board  had  long ago declined to  revise  its  earlier\\ndecision not to give permission to reopen the mines. [54C-E]\\n(ii)Rule  39 was not invalid and it was authorised by s.  17\\nof the Act (12of 1952) [55C-D].\\n50\\nRule  39 is designed, inter alia, to secure conservation  of\\ncoal.  If a mine has to be opened or reopened the Coal Board\\nhas to consider whether it is necessary to do so and it must\\ntake into consideration the requirements of the country  for\\nthe particular grade at that time.

The Parliament, while using the\\nword  \\u2019grant\\u2019  in  s.  13(1) of the Act 67  of  1957  in  s.\\n13(2)(1)  specially provided for rules being made  regarding\\nthe  manner in which and the conditions subject to  which  a\\nprospecting licence or a mining lease might be  transferred.\\nIf  these  rules were intra vires, the result was  that  the\\npetitioner  acquired the colliery in transgression of  these\\nrules.   Consequently he had not sufficient interest in  the\\nproperty to raise question about the constitutional validity\\nof r. 39 of the Coal Mines (Conservation and Safety)  Rules,\\n1954.

One\\nis  an appeal by special leave against the judgment  of  the\\nPatna  High  Court,  dismissing  an  application  filed   by\\nBiswanath  Prasad under Art. 226 of the  Constitution.   The\\nother is a petition filed under Art. 32 of the Constitution.\\nIn the petition under Art. 32, some points have been  raised\\nwhich  were  not  debated before the  High  Court  and  some\\ndocuments which were not produced before the High Court have\\nbeen  filed  in this Court.  In the circumstances  It  seems\\nconvenient to proceed to dispose of the petition first,  but\\nwe  will,  where  appropriate,  indicate  the  finding   and\\nreasoning  of  the  High Court on a  particular  point.   To\\ndecide the points raised\\n51\\nby  Mr.  C.  B.  Agarwala,  the  learned  counsel  for   the\\npetitioner,  it is necessary to state the facts somewhat  in\\ndetail,  for, inter alia, he submits that the action of  the\\nUnion  Government  in acquiring the petitioner\\u2019s  mines  was\\nmala fide.\\nThe  petitioner,  by deed of sale dated November  29,  1956,\\npurchased  a  colliery, called Dhobidih  Colliery,  for  Rs.\\n20,000  from the Bengal Coal Co. Ltd., Calcutta.  He held  a\\ncertificate of approval granted to him under r. 6 of Mineral\\nConcession  Rules,  1949.   According  to  him,  he  started\\nworking  the  colliery immediately.  This is denied  by  the\\nrespondents.   This is one of the issues debated before  the\\nHigh  Court,  which found it against the  petitioner.   This\\npoint  is of crucial importance for the Union Government  is\\nprohibited  by sub-s. (4) of s. 4 of the Coal Bearing  Areas\\n(Acquisition   and  Development)  Act  (20  of  1957)   from\\nacquiring  \\\"that  portion  of  land  in  which  coal  mining\\noperations are actually being carried on in conformity  with\\nthe provisions of any enactment, rule, or order for the time\\nbeing  in force.\\\" The respondents relying on this  provision\\nhowever,  say  further that even if it be assumed  that  the\\npetitioner worked the mines, this was not done in accordance\\nwith  law.  On this point also the High Court  held  against\\nthe petitioner.\\nAfter  acquiring the colliery, the petitioner, according  to\\nhim,  started  working the mine in earnest.   He  engaged  a\\nMines  Manager,  who was authorized to act as  such  by  the\\nChief  Inspector of Mines, and deposited Rs. 2,000 with  the\\nAssistant   Electrical  Engineer,  Giridih,  to  secure   an\\nelectric  connection.   He exploited the Hill Seam  and  had\\neven two shifts in the Mine.  He duly submitted returns.  He\\neven paid Sales Tax and excise on coal raised, which in  the\\nannual  return  for the year ending December  31,  1958,  he\\nclaimed,   amounted   to  4200  tons,   including   colliery\\nconsumption  and  coal used for making  coke.   He  employed\\nlabour, paying during the year 1957 a total amount of  about\\nRs. 41,000 for 1,103 man day\\u2019s work.  In this connection  we\\nwere referred to an affidavit filed before the Calcutta High\\nCourt  on behalf of the Coal Board wherein it is stated  the\\npetitioner had \\\"commenced mining operations in contravention\\nof  r.  39(1) of the Coal Mines  (Conservation  and  Safety)\\nRules,  1954,  and  further, coal was  being  dispatched  in\\ncontravention  of  r. 39(4) of the aforesaid  Rules  on  the\\nbasis  of an old grade given by the Coal Commissioner  prior\\nto  the closure of the colliery in the year 1948.  The  said\\ngrade was, however, withdrawn in February 1958.\\\"\\nFrom these facts it emerges that the petitioner did put up a\\nshow of raising coal but all these operations do not add  up\\nto\\n52\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 4 of 8 \\ncarrying  on  coal mining operations within the  meaning  of\\nsub-s.  (4) of S. 4 of the Coal Bearing  Areas  (Acquisition\\nand  Development)  Act,  1957.   At  any  rate,  argues  the\\nrespondents  counsel, the coal was raised contrary  to  law,\\nand at the time of the acquisition by the Government no coal\\nmining  operations  were  being carried  on.   To  this  the\\npetitioner\\u2019s  counsel replies that r. 39 of the  Coal  Mines\\n(Conservation  and Safety Rules) 1954, under which the  Coal\\nBoard  refused  permission to open the  colliery  was  ultra\\nvires as the Union Government could not make this rule under\\ns. 17 of the Coal Mines (Conservation and Safety) Act,  1952\\n(12 of 1952), and it was this illegal refusal to reopen  the\\nmines that resulted in the colliery not being worked at  the\\ntime  of  the  Notification.  The learned  counsel  for  the\\npetitioner  further  says  that  even if  r.  39  is  valid,\\npermission  was refused mala fide, with the ulterior  object\\nof avoiding the prohibition laid down in s. 4(4) of the Coal\\nBearing Areas (Acquisition and Development Act) 1957.   Now.\\nwhat  are the facts which are relevant to this part  of  the\\ncase ? The Bengal Coal Company, from whom the petitioner had\\nacquired the colliery, stopped working the colliery in 1949.\\n\\u2019This  fact  is  mentioned  in  the  application  which  the\\npetitioner submitted on January 19, 1957, for reopening  the\\nmines,  under  r.  39 of the Coal  Mines  (Conservation  and\\nSafety) Rules 1954.  It is further stated in the application\\nthat the reasons for closure by previous owner are not known\\nbut  it  appears that due to non-availability of  power  and\\ntransport the risings were very poor and eventually  closed.\\nIt follows from the statements in the application that  when\\nthe petitioner acquired the colliery it had been closed  for\\nmore  than eight years.  The explanation subsequently  given\\nby  the  petitioner that this application was  made  through\\nclerical  mistake cannot be believed.  On October 10,  1957,\\nafter some correspondence, the petitioner was informed  that\\nthe  Coal  Board had not granted permission  to  reopen  the\\ncolliery  \\\"  as  production  of more  coal  of  the  quality\\nexpected from the Seams Proposed to be worked by you is  not\\nnow required for the Giridih area\\\" In spite of this refusal,\\nthe  petitioner carried on correspondence with the  Regional\\nInspector of Mines, Dhanbad Inspection Region, regarding the\\nworking  plan of the colliery.  This  correspondence  cannot\\nadvance  the petitioner\\u2019s case in any manner.   On  February\\n24,  1958, the Coal Board withdrew the Grade IIIB fixed  for\\nthe  colliery  with immediate effect.   The  petitioner  was\\nfurther requested not to despatch any coal from the colliery\\nhenceforth.   From the above recital it is quite clear  that\\nif  it is assumed that the petitioner worked the  mines,  he\\ndid it contrary to r. 39 and, therefore, the rule if  valid,\\nthe prohibition\\n53\\nin.  s.  4(4)  of the Coal Bearing  Areas  (Acquisition  and\\nDevelopment) Act does not come into operation.\\nAfter this, the petitioner started representing to the  Coal\\nBoard: for cancelling its orders.  By its letter dated March\\n24,  1958,  the Coal Board firmly reiterated its  stand  and\\nwarned the petitioner that he had raised and dispatched coal\\nin  contravention  of  Coal Mines  Conservation  and  Safety\\nRules,  1954.  On January 30, 1959, the Government of  India\\nrefused  to interfere with the decision of the (\\u2019oil  Board.\\nOn July 20, 1959, the Board declined to revise its decision.\\nBut  the  petitioner  was  not  disheartened.   He   started\\nrepresenting again and for some reason, not apparent on  the\\nrecord, the Coal Board started showing a receptive mind.  In\\nOctober  1959, it asked for the production of a  licence  or\\nregistration  certificate under the Industries  (Development\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 5 of 8 \\nand  Regulation) Act, 1951 (65 of 1951).  Some letters  were\\nexchanged on this topic.  Then the petitioner approached the\\nUnion  Government,, who asked for more information.  In  the\\nreply,  the  petitioner stated that \\u2019on receipt  of  several\\nletters  from  the concerned department the working  of  the\\ncolliery  was  stopped from August 1,  1958\\u2019.   Later,  more\\ninformation  was  asked  for  and  supplied  to  the   Union\\nGovernment.  Ultimately, the petitioner was informed that it\\nwas not necessary for him to have a licence under Act 65  of\\n195 1. From now on the petitioner was time and again told by\\nthe  Coal  Board that the matter  was  under  consideration,\\nwhile  the  petitioner  continued to  press  his  case.   On\\nOctober  17,  1960,  the petitioner was  informed  that  the\\nmatter  had been referred to the Government of India,  whose\\ninstructions were awaited.  From now on the scene shifts  to\\nthe  Ministry  of  Steel,  Mines and  Fuel,  which  kept  on\\nacknowledging letters ad-dressed by the petitioner.   Enqui-\\nries  were  made  in April 1961  whether  the  colliery  was\\nunworked.  On July 1, 1961, the Central Government issued  a\\nNotification, No. S.O. 15 8 1, under sub-s. ( 1 ) of s. 4 of\\nthe  Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and  Development)  Act,\\n1957, giving notice of its intention to prospect for coal in\\nthe  colliery of the petitioner.  Another  Notification  No.\\nS.O.  484, under s. 4(1) of the Act of 1957, was  issued  on\\nFebruary 6, 1962, in respect of another area of 25.15 acres.\\nThe petitioner did not file any objections to the  proposed.\\nacquisition under s. 8 of the Act.  It was only on  November\\n23, 1961, that the petitioner was informed by the Government\\nthat  the  area in question appears to  have  been  notified\\nunder sub-s. (1) of s. 4 of the Act 20 of 1957.  In reply to\\nthis  intimation \\u2019 the petitioner asserted that he  was  not\\nbound in law by the aforesaid notification.\\n54\\nIn  para  32 of the petition, the  petitioner  alleged  mala\\nfides  thus:\\\"that,  thus it is absolutely clear,  the  whole\\nintent  and  purpose of the orders of the respondent  No.  2\\n(i.e.  the  Coal  Board)  and  the  notification  issued  by\\nrespondent  No.  1  (i.e.  the  Union  Government)  and  the\\nsubsequent  lingering of the matter on one plea  or  another\\nwere  quite  mala fide.\\\" In para 21 it is  stated  that  the\\nrespondents  and  their authorities colluded  and  conspired\\nagainst  the petitioner with ulterior motive and  collateral\\nreasons    and   paid   no   heed   to   the    petitioner\\u2019s\\nrepresentations.\\\"\\nThese allegations are quite vague and are not sufficient  to\\nallege  a case of conspiracy between the Coal Board and  the\\nUnion ,Government to deprive the petitioner of his colliery.\\nApart  from  this, the above recital of the facts  does  not\\nlend any support to any conspiracy existing between the Coal\\nBoard  and  the Union Government.  That there was  delay  in\\ndisposing of the petitioner\\u2019s representations is evident but\\ndelay, by itself, is hardly evidence of mala fide, specially\\nas  the Coal Board had as long ago as July 1959 declined  to\\nrevise its earlier decision not to give permission to reopen\\nthe  mines.  There was a proceeding under s. 147,  ,Criminal\\nProcedure  Code,  between  the  petitioner  and  the  Super-\\nintendent of Giridih Collieries, worked by Respondent No. 3,\\nthe  National Coal Development Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd.,  and\\nthis  litigation  is  also called in aid  for  showing  mala\\nfides.  We are unable to see how the fact, assuming it to be\\ntrue,  that  the said Superintendent was on  inimical  terms\\nwith  the  petitioner, shows mala fide on the  part  of  the\\nUnion   Government.    Consequently,  we   hold   that   the\\nNotifications Nos.  S.O. 1581 and S.O. 484 are not  vitiated\\non account of any mala fides.\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 6 of 8 \\nThis  takes  us to the question whether r. 39  of  the  Coal\\nMines ,Conservation and Safety Rules, 1954, is ultra  vires.\\nThe said rule 39 and S. 17 of -the Coal Mine-, (Conservation\\nand Safety) ,Act, 1952, are in the following terms :-\\n              \\\"Rule 39--opening and reopening of Coal Mines.\\n              (1)   No coal mine or seam shall be opened and\\n              no  coal mine or seam the working whereof  has\\n              been tinued for a period exceeding six  months\\n              shall  be reopened and no operation  shall  be\\n              commenced  without  the  prior  permission  in\\n              writing of the Board and except in  accordance\\n              with such directions as the Board may give.\\\"\\n              \\\"S.  17(1)-The  Central  Government  may,   by\\n              notification  in  the  Official  Gazette   and\\n              subject to the condition\\n              55\\n              of  previous publication, make rules to  carry\\n              out the purposes of this Act.\\\"\\nSection 17(2) gives various specific matters on which  rules\\ncan be made but none of these covers r. 39.  But in spite of\\nthis we are of the opinion that the impugned rule is  valid.\\nThe object of the Act is to provide for the conservation  of\\ncoal  and make further provision for safety in  coal  mines.\\nSection  7 empowers the Central Government to exercise  such\\npowers and take or cause to be taken all such measures as it\\nmay  deem necessary or proper or as may be  prescribed.   We\\nconsider  that  r.  39 is designed, inter  alia,  to  secure\\nconservation  of  coal.  If a mine has to be opened  or  re-\\nopened  the  Coal  Board  has  to  consider  whether  it  is\\nnecessary  to  do so.  It must take into  consideration  the\\nrequirements of the country for the particular grade at that\\ntime.   If  a particular grade of coal is not  required,  it\\nwould conserve it for future use, if it is not allowed to be\\nraised.   In the result, we hold that r. 39 is  not  invalid\\nand it is authorized by s. 17 of the Act (12 of 1952).\\nThe  next point that arises out of the pleadings is  whether\\nrr.  37  and 48 of the Mineral Concession Rules,  1949,  are\\nultra   vires  the  Mines  and  Minerals   (Regulation   and\\nDevelopment)  Act,  1948.   This  point  is  raised  by  the\\npetitioner in his counter-affidavit to defeat the  objection\\nof  the  respondents that the petitioner  had  acquired  the\\nlease  of  the  colliery in contravention of  the  law  and,\\ntherefore,  has  not any right to allege that r. 39  of  the\\nCoal Mine,, Conservation and Safety Rules, 1954 is violative\\nof  Art.  19 of the Constitution.   The  Mineral  Concession\\nRules,  1949, were made in exercise of the powers  conferred\\nby   s.  5  of  the  Mines  and  Minerals  (Regulation   and\\nDevelopment) Act, 1948.  Section 5(1), before it was amended\\nby Act 67 of 1957, reads thus\\n              \\\"5.   Power to make rules as  respects  mining\\n              leases:\\n              (1)   \\u2019Me    Central   Government   may,    by\\n              notification  in  the  official  gazette  make\\n              rules  for  regulating  the  grant  of  mining\\n              leases  or for prohibiting the grant  of  such\\n              leases  in  respect of any mineral or  in  any\\n              area.\\\"\\n              Rules 37 and 48 are in the following terms\\n              \\\"37.   Transfer of leave-The lessee may,  with\\n              the previous sanction of the State  Government\\n              and subject to the conditions specified in the\\n              first  proviso  to  rule 35 and  in  rule  38,\\n              transfer  his  lease or any  right,  title  or\\n              interest  therein,  to  a  person  holding   a\\n              certificate of approval on payment of a fee of\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 7 of 8 \\n              Rs. 100 to the State Government.\\n              56\\n              Provided  that no mining lease or  any  right,\\n              title  or interest therein in respect  of  any\\n              mineral  specified in Schedule IV shall be  so\\n              transferred except with the previous  approval\\n              of the Central Government.\\\"\\n              \\\"48.   Transfer of  assignment-No  prospecting\\n              licence   or   mining  lease  to   which   the\\n              provisions of this Chapter shall apply or  any\\n              right,  title or interest in such  license  or\\n              lease shall be transferred except to a  person\\n              holding  a  certificate of approval  from  the\\n              State Government having jurisdiction over  the\\n              land  in respect of which such  concession  is\\n              granted.\\n              Provided that no prospecting license or mining\\n              lease or any right, title or interest in  such\\n              license  or  lease in respect of  any  mineral\\n              specified in Schedule IV shall be  transferred\\n              except  with  the  previous  approval  of  the\\n              Central Government.\\\"\\nThese rules prohibit the transfer of a lease of a coal  mine\\nexcept With the previous approval of the Central Government.\\nIt is argued on behalf of the petitioner that these rules do\\nnot  regulate  the  grant of a mining  lease  for  the  word\\n\\u2019grant\\u2019 does not include transfer or assignment of a  lease.\\nIt  is true that in a particular context, as existed in  the\\ncase  of  Mason, Herring and Brooks v. Harris(1),  the  word\\n\\u2019grant\\u2019  may  not  include an assignment.  But  we  are  not\\nsatisfied  that the word \\u2019grant\\u2019 in the context of S. 5  has\\nthis narrow meaning.  The word \\u2019grant\\u2019, inter alia, connotes\\ntransfer  of  property  and  mining  leases  are   property.\\nFurther,  mining leases are usually of long duration and  it\\ncould   not  have  been  the  intention  not   to   regulate\\nassignments  of  such  leases.  We  are  fortified  in  this\\nConclusion by the fact that Parliament, while using the word\\n\\u2019grant\\u2019  in  s. 13 (1) of Act 67 of 1957, in s. 13  (2)  (1)\\nspecifically  provides  for rules being made  regarding  the\\nmanner  in  Which  and the conditions  subject  to  which  a\\nprospecting  licence or a mining lease may  be  transferred.\\nIf  these  rules  are intra vires, the result  is  that  the\\npetitioner  acquired the colliery in transgression of  these\\nrules.  Consequently, he has not sufficient interest in  the\\nproperty   to  raise  questions  about  the   constitutional\\nvalidity of r. 39 of the Coal Mines Conservation and  Safety\\nRules, 1954.\\nOne point urged on behalf of the petitioner now remains, and\\nthat is the plea of discrimination.  The plea is put in  the\\nfollowing terms, in para 31 of his petition:\\n(1)  [1921] 1 K.B. 653.\\n57\\n.lm15\\n\\\"That  although the respondent No. 2 refused  permission  to\\nthe  petitioner to open the colliery and withdrew the  grade\\non  the plea that no more of the quality was  required  from\\nthe Giridih area, it granted permission on June 6, 1959, for\\nreopening  of  Kabari  Bad  Colliery in  the  same  area  of\\nKarhabaree  for  raising  Grade IIIB coal  which  was  lying\\nunworked  for the last about 10 years although the  colliery\\nlies  in the midst of collieries being worked by  respondent\\nNo.  3 due to which the latter had to allow them to use  its\\n(N.C.D.C.\\u2019s) own road in the area.\\\"\\nThe respondent\\u2019s case is that while permission to reopen the\\nmines was refused to the petitioner in October, 1957, it was\\n\\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN \\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA\\nPage 8 of 8 \\non  June  6. 1959, that the Kabari Bad  Colliery  was  given\\npermission.   And more important is the allegation that  the\\ngrade was fixed for this colliery as IIIB on March 30, 1963,\\ni.e.  five  years after this grade was  withdrawn  from  the\\npetitioner.   Demand  for  Grade IIIB  coal  can  easily  be\\ndifferent after the lapse of five years, and the Coal  Board\\nwas  entitled to decide the case of Kabari Bad  Colliery  on\\nthe   facts   existing  in  1959  and   1963.    Under   the\\ncircumstances, we are not satisfied that there has been  any\\ndiscrimination in violation of Art. 14 of the Constitution.\\nIn view of our findings above, we dismiss the petition,  but\\nin the circumstances of the case, we order that the  parties\\nwill bear their own costs.\\nNo  other  point  arises in the appeal and  we  dismiss  the\\nappeal with no order as to costs.\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n58\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
